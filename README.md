# Query-Plans
Connecting Query and Query Plans

•	Retrieved Query Plans for SQL Queries using PostgreSQL. Used information retrieved from query execution plan (QEP) and alternative query plans (AQP) to annotate corresponding SQL Queries.

•	Explain and identify how the query processor executes different components and how optimal operators are chosen as numerous alternate plans are available. 

•	Created a dynamic GUI using python and tkinter, for user to input SQL Query and receive QEP, AQP and the annotations associated with both.
